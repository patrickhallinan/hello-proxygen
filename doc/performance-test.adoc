= performance test

== usage

=== start server

```bash
hello/hello --minloglevel=1 --echo_request_lag=50

- minloglevel: run server with INFO logging turned off (INFO=0, WARN=1, ERROR=2)
- echo_request_lag: milliseconds to wait before sending response (default=0)
```

=== run performance test

```bash
test/performance --number_of_requests=100 --num_connections=10

parameters:

target_host - Host or IP address
target_port - Host port
num_connections
number_of_requests
payload_size - number of bytes to send in each request
```
