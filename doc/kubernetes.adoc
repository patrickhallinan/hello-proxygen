= kubernetes

Plan:  This containerizes the server, the feature test, and the performance test.  Then deploys and runs them.  

This uses `Kind` (Kubernetes in Docker)


MicroK8s


== macOS:

* Description: Kind is designed for running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container "nodes". It's perfect for testing and development because it can simulate multi-node clusters on a single machine.

* Setup for 3 Nodes: 
** Install Docker for macOS first.
Install kind using brew install kind or by downloading the binary from the official site.
** Use a configuration file to define your cluster with 3 nodes:

```yaml
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
- role: control-plane
- role: worker
- role: worker
```

** Create the cluster with kind create cluster --config=your-config-file.yaml.


== Ubuntu:

* Description: As mentioned, Kind can be used on Ubuntu as well for local development.
* Setup for 3 Nodes: 
    ** Install Docker (sudo apt-get install docker.io) and kind (GO111MODULE="on" go get sigs.k8s.io/kind@v0.17.0 or download the binary).
    ** Use the same configuration file approach as for macOS to define a 3-node cluster.


==  Rocky Linux:

* Description: Similar to Ubuntu, Kind can be used for local Kubernetes testing.
* Setup for 3 Nodes: 
    ** Install Docker (sudo yum install docker-ce) and kind (download the binary or use go get).
    ** Use the configuration file method to create a 3-node cluster.


== Note:
 
* For all systems, ensure you have sufficient system resources (CPU, RAM, disk space) to run multiple nodes on a single machine.
* Network configurations might need tweaking depending on how you set up your nodes (e.g., using bridge networking for VMs or containers).
*These solutions simulate multi-node clusters but are not as performant or reflective of real multi-machine setups due to running on a single host.
