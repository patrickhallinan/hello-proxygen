== building on wsl - ubuntu 24.04

NOTE: when clang was installed its libstdc++ dependency was missing.  This was strange because gcc was working fine.

----
sudo apt install clang libstdc++-14-dev

== building proxygen on rocky linux 9

NOTE: In the last clean build on rocky linux failed to build the first time.

This was a memory issue.  Increasing to 20GB fixed this.
